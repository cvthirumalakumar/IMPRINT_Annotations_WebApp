Nineteen years? Do you really mean to tell me you haven't had a suit since then?
That's right. I don't often wear a suit, you see, so they tend to last a long time.
Nineteen years is certainly a long time; and even if you don't wear them much, your old one must have lasted well.
Oh, it did. They did a very good job on it.
What was the name of the tailor?
Philipson. It's quite a small shop right at the end of King street.
I know it. Rather a shabby-looking place. I've never been in there.
I wouldn't call it shabby, but it isn't very modern, I admit. However, they're very obliging, and take a great deal of trouble.
So I can see. I think I'll go along there. I need a new suit. Oh, by the way, what sort of prices do they charge?
Pretty reasonable, really. This was eighty pounds.
That's not bad. I think I'll look in there tomorrow.
Yes, do. Mention my name if you like. It won't do any harm, and it might do some good. I've just paid my bill.
I need a couple of shirts. Grey terylene, please.
Certainly, sir. I'll just get some out. Would you mind taking a seat for a minute. I shan't be long.
No, don't be too long. I haven't very much time.
Very good, sir. Here's a nice shirt; we sell a lot of this one.
Do you, now? Yes, it's the sort of style I want, but I asked for grey. This is purple.
Purple, sir? Surely not. It's what we call silver-blue.
Well, it looks purple to me. Anyway, I'd like something a little less bright, more like the one I'm wearing.
Oh, that sort of grey. I haven't seen that for years.
I bought it here, six months ago.
Did you really, sir? It must have been old stock.
Well, see if you've still got any left, will you?
Ah, yes, here we are. I'm sorry about the dust, sir. Can I lend you a handkerchief?
No, thank you, I'll survive. Yes, that looks better. Have you another one like it?
I'm afraid not, sir. It's probably the last in the country.
Oh, all right, I'll take it. How much is it?
Twelve pounds, sir. It was a very good shirt in its time.
I should think so, at twelve pounds. Can I pay by cheque?
Certainly, sir. You have a cheque card?
Yes, I have.
And would you just put your name and address on the back?
I can never understand that. If the cheque was no good, I'd put a false name and address, wouldn't I?
You're joking, sir, of course. I naturally assume your cheque is good.
Very trusting of you. It is, as a matter of fact.
Is there anything else you need, sir? Ties, socks, vests?
I don't think so, thank you. Good morning.
Good day, sir.
